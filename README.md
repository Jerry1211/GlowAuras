# GlowAuras

GlowAuras lets you capture ability glow procs and display customizable on-screen alerts for each spell.

Learn a proc once, then configure:
- Custom alert text  
- Sound (LibSharedMedia supported)  
- Overlay size and position  
- Optional duration timer  

Lightweight, focused, and built specifically for tracking proc-based abilities without full UI frameworks.

Use `/ga` to open settings.
